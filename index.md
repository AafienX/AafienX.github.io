Here we go...

Ek journey jisme tum aur mai saath rhenge, the only difference iss ki tum view only mode me honge unlike me ;)
Never thought ki life ko aise document krke rakhunga, like I never liked this idea. Pr documented rkhne ke faayde bhi hai, meko apni life ke kisse bechne ni hai, bss share krne hai, kisike saath, maybe yeh tum pdh rhe ho toh un me tum bhi shaamil ho.

Abhi kl se cheeze kaafi bdlne wali hai, like sab kuch nya nya hoga, last time aise 2 saal pehle hua tha, meko uss period ki memories ni yaad krni so, nervous toh hu hi, hmesha ki tarah, aur drr bhi lg rha hai, lekin utna jyada nhi, confidence kaafi bdh gya hai, comparitively jo kuch mahine pehle tha, mushkil ni hona chahiye, anyways, yeh toh rhi kl ki baat; kaafi dino se ek aur cheez bahut dustak de rhi hai baar baar, long term ke baare me kya socha hai, hmm kaaynaat ne puri shiddat se muze iss department se milwaya hai, i mean literally, aise itne saare chote chote decisions have lead upto me joining this branch, Physics ke liye aaj bhi utna hi pyaar hai passion hai, especially astronomy. 

Basically jo sabse basic aur fundamental questions hai universe ke, aise sawalon ke jawab dhoondne me mai apna chote se chota bhi contribution de sakoon toh will be very nice i thought. But at the same time jha itney saare log (almost sabhi) khudko in sawalon se distract krke money ke piche bhaag rhe hai aur bss yaa toh survival krne me busy hai yaa rich hai toh life enjoy krna chahte hai. Aisi society me aam baat hai ki money kaafi dominant factor hai, aur though mere goals hmesha se clear rhe hai, pr mai bhi ek thik thak life jeena chahta hoon, I mean koi bhi poor hona deserve hi nhi krta, sabko ek dignified life jeene ka haq milna chaiye, unfortunately, itney salon ke evolution ke baad bhi, humans apne aap ko survival ke khel se aazad ni kr paye hai. That's a different topic jis pr baad me kbhi baat krenge. Pehli problem apni life astronomy ko dedicate krne ki hai ki Money, yeh passion me bahut jyada paisa hai nhi, especially not here in india, second reason is lack of opportunities and the steep competition. Eventually causing less chances of me being successfully an Astrophysicist let alone an successful Astrophysicist.





2N2B-

Kya karoon mai, shuruwaat se shuru krne ka samay bhi nhi hai, naa hi woh smart tarika hai, isse accha toh chalte raho, koi dikkat aaye toh dekh lena, hmm aadat nhi hai, pr krna toh hai naa... Kitna sure hu ki meko koi minor yaa major ni chaiye, kitna sure hu ki mai physics hi padhna chahta hu puri life dedicate krne ke liye taiyaar hu kya? Shayad jawab ni hai mere paas, yeh toh sure hai ki astro se related kuch bhi kruga toh i am okk. But agr mai koi non core me try kruga toh my direct competition will be those who are already studying that course for four yrs. Hmm agr aise soche ki Physics + CS/AI/EE minor > Physics major, toh thik lg rha hai, lekin kitna faayda hoga, higher studies me in minors kaa? Hmm mai bahot lazy hu, jb mera aim ms-PhD hai toh mai minors vgera me time waste ni krna chahunga.

Let us say ki mene plan kra, ke Physics me hi aage jana hai, toh aaram se 4+2+3+3++ years of study and even after this whatever field i choose research will be part of my job always and forever. Toh sab jaankr bhi Higher Studies choose krna chahte ho kya? aaaaa.... I don't actually know!

A day I would like to forget, and it kept getting worse every passing hour, woke up late not late enough to miss breakfast but lazy enough to. I hate lunch, hate daylight, hate going out in sun, hate the same old dal and rasam and weird dry sabjis for lunch, hate rushing from hostel to acads thrice, hate it when still after all the rush the only thing i was supposed to do goes pending, hate it when results are declared in classes, hate it when others get to see your answer sheets before you, hate it when everyone has already judged and made their opinions about you, hate it when I don't have to pretend my exam was bad, hate it when I feel embarrased, hate it when I hate my own self, hate being in here, just hate it!
But I love the fact I Got people who despite of my ups/downs ready to play games and I also Love to end hectic day with a light hearted bollywood movie.











3rd July 12:15 

Bicycle ride on rainy evening, cold breeze and light drizzle and the sky washed in golden rays coming from the best sunset I have witnessed in years, with some of my bestest friends, oohooo!!! What a day was yesterday, one of those memories I would like to store forever. 
Today, I got one interview in some 15-20 minutes yepp, you got me it's vibess again. May be third time for me that I applied for Vibes, and also third time that I won't appear for interview. Why? May be scared of failure, as always feeling unprepared, feeling I am not worth it. May be something else...
I know, this way it is never going to work, I have to overcome this, I will eventually, but right now, I do not feel ready for any failure or any rejection. :| 
(Thanks for encouraging, sorry I can't.)
